TeamHambre Game

  Description:

    Run TeamHambre.java using your farvorite Java compiler to play the game. 

    The goal is to survive for long as possible against the endless waves of enemies. 
    
    Each time an enemy makes its way to the other end of the screen, 
    it is teleported back to the other side, and gets a speed boost.
    
    For each wave survived, the doom counter goes up, 
    which is a multiplier for the enemies' 
    spawn amount per wave and speed.
    
  Controls:
    Gorilla: Arrow keys for movement, spacebar to shoot bananas. 
    Chicken: Numberpad for movement, enter to shoot eggs.
